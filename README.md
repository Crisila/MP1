# HANGMAN

By Crisila Ballecer AKA Crisila Aban

## Inspiration for the game

I love games that helps me think. I remember playing hangman as a kid and thought how I can use my html, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge to turn it into a web game.


## Controls and How-To-Play

Welcome to Hangman! The classic word-guessing game where every guess counts!

### Objective:
Guess the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses, so choose wisely!

### Instructions:
1. Start the Game: Click the "Reset Game" button to begin a new round.

2. Guessing Letters:
- You will see a series of blank spaces representing the letters in the word.
- Type a letter you think is in the word.
- If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the corresponding blanks.
- If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.

3. Keep Track: You can see the letters you have already guessed below the word.
Be cautious, as each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing!

4. Winning or Losing:
- If you guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn, you win! Celebrate your victory!
- If the hangman is completed before you guess the word, it's game over. Don’t worry, you can always play again!

5. Tips for Success:
- Start with common letters like 'E', 'A', 'R', 'T', and 'O'.
